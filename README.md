# 💊 Pharmacy Management System (Enterprise Desktop Application)

A **95% complete enterprise-grade Pharmacy Management System** built using **C#, .NET, and SQL Server**, designed to handle real-world pharmacy operations including inventory, billing, reporting, and advanced database-driven workflows.

---

## 🚀 Overview

This system simulates a **real pharmacy business environment** with a strong focus on:

* Complex inventory management (multi-units, pricing tiers)
* Sales & purchase lifecycle
* Customer account tracking
* POS (Point of Sale) system
* Advanced reporting using Crystal Reports
* Database-centric architecture using SQL Server & Stored Procedures

> ⚡ This project represents a **transition step toward Full Stack .NET (ASP.NET Core + React)**

---

## 🧠 Core Features

### 🛒 Sales & POS System

* Create sales invoices
* Handle returns (ReSale / ReBuy)
* Multi-unit pricing (Large / Medium / Small)
* Discount handling with limits

---

### 📦 Inventory System (Advanced)

* Multi-unit item system:

  * Large / Medium / Small units
  * Separate buy/sell prices per unit
* Stock tracking & quantity control
* Demand limit alerts
* Expiry tracking

---

### 👥 Customer & Accounts

* Customer profiles
* Transaction tracking
* Account balance management

---

### 🏢 Business Modules

* Branch management
* Company & supplier management
* Item classification system

---

## 🧬 Advanced Database Design

The system uses a **highly normalized and relational database structure**:

### 🔗 Core Relationships

Each item is linked to:

* Dosage Form
* Generic Name
* Class of Action
* Scientific Group
* Company
* Storage Location (Place)
* Units

---

### 🧾 Item Entity (Complex Business Model)

The `Items` table demonstrates advanced database design:

* Multiple barcodes support
* Multi-unit hierarchy (Large → Medium → Small)
* Separate pricing per unit
* Quantity tracking per unit
* Flags for:

  * Narcotic
  * Refrigerated
  * Imported / Local
  * Expiry tracking

---

### 🧠 Example Fields

* `ItemLargeUnitSalePrice`
* `ItemMediumQuantity`
* `ItemSmallUnitBuyPrice`
* `ItemDemandLimit`
* `ItemMaxDiscount`
* `ItemExpiry`
* `ItemNarcotic`

👉 This reflects **real-world pharmacy complexity**, not a simple CRUD system.

## 📊 Reporting System (Crystal Reports)

The system includes a dedicated reporting module:

### 📁 RPT/

Contains:

* Crystal Report files (.rpt)

### 📌 Features:

* Sales invoices printing
* Purchase reports
* Inventory reports
* Customer transaction reports

### 🎯 Benefits:

* Professional printable documents
* Separation of reporting logic
* Business-ready reporting system
